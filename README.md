# SnakeGame

This branch doesn't work - NCurses is much different from gs.

The classic snake game, in Elixir, on the command line. Use WASD for movement, Q to quit.

## Installation

This project requires ncurses. If you're on a Mac and have homebrew available, it's on there:

```bash
brew install ncurses
```

Then it should run via mix.
